#Paradox Browser
A new web browser by me, Zantonlan.

So far, I have like nothing done, but that will change soon, hopefully. I'm currently working on the basic parser and building the DOM tree. Once I got the DOM tree done, I'll flesh out the translateTag function (currently empty), and make the renderer. I'll implement tags in order of new-ness, starting at HTML 1.0 and working my way up to HTML 4.01 (and possibly beyond).
